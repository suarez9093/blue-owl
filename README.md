### Description

<p align="center">
Please create a responsive React application (using javascript or
        typescript) that displays a list of cards on a page as shown below.
        There is a fixed-width pane on the right side of the window that remains
        attached to the right side when the user re-sizes. Inside the pane,
        please paste a formatted display of these instructions. And if the
        browser width is small, hide the pane completely. There is a
        fixed-height toolbar on the top of the window that has buttons. There is
        a fixed-height footer on the bottom of the window that just shows the
        text "footer". The main center portion of the window is the card
        container. It should start out with zero cards. Cards are only added
        when the user clicks 'add card' in the top toolbar. It has a vertical
        scrollbar which can be used if there are too many cards to display at
        once. It lays out the cards in rows, wrapping as needed. In this mockup
        only 2 cards are shown per row, but if the browser is wider, 3 or more
        cards might fit in a row. If narrower, maybe only 1 card would be
        visible. Each card has a set pixel size, such as 300px by 250px, but you
        can decide what size you wish to use. Upon instantiation, a card should
        be given a random number between 0 and 100 and display it in the center
        of the card. Each card has a button in the top-right corner which can be
        used to delete the card. If the user clicks the 'sort cards' button at
        the top of the page, please sort the cards in order of the number that
        is shown in the center of each card.
